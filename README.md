# Break The Code
"Break The Code" is a new game for the Arduboy, based on the well-known ‘Simon’ or ‘Senso’ (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senso_(Spiel)), in which the player has to follow a sequence of sounds and colours.
It was also know as "Touch Me" as an arcade game released in 1974 by Atari. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_Me_(arcade_game))

In this game you are a burglar and have to repeat the code to open the safe and get hold of the treasure inside.
It gets harder and harder as you move up the career ladder, but eventually you will be rewarded.
