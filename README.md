# Brake The Code
Brake The Code is a new game for the Arduboy, based on the well-known ‘Simon’ or ‘Senso’, in which the player has to follow a sequence of sounds and colours.

In this game you are a burglar and have to repeat the code to open the safe and get hold of the treasure inside.
It gets harder and harder as you move up the career ladder, but eventually you will be rewarded.
